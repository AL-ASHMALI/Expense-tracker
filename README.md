# Expense-tracker 
This simple expense tracker application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. 
This application was made with a minimalistic design to allow you to use it effortlessly. 
Even though it is a relatively simple application, it was structured in a way that allows it to have the potential to be 
a very large and complex project. 

In the process of me learning Full-Stack web development, I have built this project. 

If you see it I hope you like it. ðŸ˜ƒ
